# calculator

* About / Status: <br/>

  * This project is comprised of html, css & js.
  * It basically contains all the necessary calculator operations.
  * All bonus requirements are completed too.
  * Much time was spent on debugging & QA of different logical checks.
  * Did't use the vibrant dark background colors to give calculator a more natural, real look as very dark colors looked
   nice but hid the borders of various sections.  
* Future Ideas:  
  * Changing Color Choices for various calculator parts.
  * Further functionality.
