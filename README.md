# calculator

* About / Status: <br/>

  * This project is comprised of html, css & js.
  * It basically contains all the necessary calculator operations.
  * All bonus requirements are completed too.
  * Used the vibrant dark background colors to give calculator a nicer look rather than a natural, real look.  Very dark colors look
   nice but hid the borders of various sections. Alternate look can be enabled in CSS using commented background colors in 
   #midContainer & #calScreen .  
* Future Ideas:  
  * Changing Color Choices for various calculator parts.
  * Further functionality.
